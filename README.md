# ZakatziBar

ZakatziBar is a World of Warcraft addon.<br />
ZakatziBar adds three bars near the casting bar.<br />
Each bar is responsible for tracking an array of selected in-game events for the player, party, and enemy characters.<br />
You can track procs, buffs, debuffs, cooldowns, and other special events such as a Warrior's Revenge proc in Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
The addon supports unique and non-unique spells and can handle spells that reset other spells as well as spells that proc cooldowns on other spells.<br />
It can also track class specs by looking at spec specific spells being used (or on Retail, retrieve them during the arena preparation stage).<br />
You can also track item-related events, so it would work well with trinket tracking in Classic (or WotLK). <br />

I do not actively play retail or classic, so I have not really optimized the addon's tracking yet. <br />
I am going to be updating the addon for TBC and WOTLK. <br />

The most difficult feature to add in so far is the tracking of timer reduction, because it is always approximate (active and/or passive).<br />
I am of the opinion that passive cooldown reduction is bad game design.<br />
